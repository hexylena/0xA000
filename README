0xA000 is a font family constrained by it's rasterization with a 3px x-height
(7px size). The core variants are the Regular, and Bold and pixelated, all of
these also have monospaced variants for code and terminals. 

Some more display variants come to life through mapping different shapes to
the tiles used: Dots, Boxes and Monochrome (a rougher alternative to
pixelated).

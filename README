0xA000 is a meta-modular tile-grid based font-family.

The resulting Sans Serif face, as well as mono-spaced variant of it are
designs that without additional hinting renders legible at small resolutions,
working well even without anti-aliasing; but taking advantage of any
additional shape clarity provided by grayscale and RGBA based anti-aliasing
technologies.

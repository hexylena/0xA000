A specimen for 0xA000 created when David Gowers was surveying fonts that
rasterize to pixeling level cleanliness when rasterized aliased. Useful for
high framerate eink, gif animations, embedded displays and more. (the variants
annotated with c-spac = - 1 are rasterized with a spacing override; indicating
room for improvement in pixel grid-constrained design decisions.) <img
